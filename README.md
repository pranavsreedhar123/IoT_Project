## What did we do?
1. We received weather data from an open-source API, sent the data to the Raspberry Pi via MQTT, stored it on an SQL database, and displayed the data on Grafana.
2. We worked with the NodeMCU and sensors, programming them using the Arduino IDE
     - Created a POC of two automation projects:
        - [IR Buzzer Project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxgHeV5pN74)
        - [Smart Fan Project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRMwInP_f24)
